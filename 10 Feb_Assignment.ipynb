    "When opening a file, you can specify different modes based on how you intend to use the file. The modes determine whether you want to read, write, or append to the file, and also whether you want to create a new file if it doesn't exist. The common modes for file opening are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Read mode ('r'): This mode allows you to read the contents of an existing file. If the file doesn't exist, an error is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write mode ('w'): This mode is used to create a new file for writing. If a file with the same name already exists, its contents will be truncated (deleted) before writing to it. If the file doesn't exist, a new file will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Append mode ('a'): This mode is used to open a file for appending data at the end. If the file doesn't exist, a new file will be created. Existing content is preserved, and new data is added to the end of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Read and Write mode ('r+'): This mode allows you to read and write to an existing file. The file pointer is initially at the beginning of the file.\n",

    "It is important to close a file after you have finished using it for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource management: When you open a file, the operating system allocates certain resources to handle the file operations, such as memory buffers and file descriptors. If you don't close the file, these resources may not be released immediately, leading to resource leaks. Closing the file ensures that these resources are properly released, preventing potential issues like running out of system resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data integrity: Closing a file ensures that all the data you have written to or read from the file is flushed or saved to the underlying storage. If you don't close the file and terminate the program abruptly, some data may remain buffered in memory and not be permanently written to the file. Closing the file guarantees that the data is properly written and the file is in a consistent state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Access by other processes: By closing the file, you release any locks or restrictions that your program may have placed on the file. This allows other processes or programs to access the file without conflicts. Failing to close a file might result in other processes being unable to open or modify the file until it is closed."
