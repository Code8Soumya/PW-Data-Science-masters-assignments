    "    An exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program, disrupting the normal flow of the program's instructions. When an exception is raised, the program jumps to a specific code block called an exception handler that can handle the exception and prevent the program from terminating abruptly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between exceptions and syntax errors is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions occur during the runtime of a program, while syntax errors are detected by the Python interpreter before the program starts running.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors are caused by violations of the Python language syntax rules, such as misspelled keywords or incorrect indentation. These errors prevent the program from being compiled or interpreted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions, on the other hand, occur when the program is running and encounters an unforeseen condition or situation that it cannot handle, such as dividing by zero or accessing an undefined variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors need to be fixed before the program can be executed, while exceptions can be handled and recovered from within the program using exception handling mechanisms like try-except blocks.|"
