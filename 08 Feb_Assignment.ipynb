    "Defining common interfaces: Abstract base classes (ABCs) allow you to define a common set of methods that related classes should implement.\n",
    "Enforcing method implementation: Abstract base classes can enforce that certain methods must be implemented by subclasses.\n",
    "Enabling polymorphism: Abstract base classes enable polymorphism, which means that objects of different classes can be treated interchangeably based on their shared interface defined in the abstract base class.\n",

    "Define a Class: Create a class that represents the abstraction you want to achieve. This class should encapsulate the relevant data and behaviors.\n",

    "\n",
    "Provide Public Methods: Define public methods, also known as accessor and mutator methods or getters and setters, to provide controlled access to the encapsulated data. These methods allow external code to interact with the class's data without directly accessing or modifying it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hide Implementation Details: Make sure to hide the implementation details of the class and expose only the essential functionality. The external code interacting with the class should only need to know about the public methods and not the internal workings of the class."

They serve as a template for creating subclasses that provide concrete implementations for the abstract methods defined in the abstract base class. "
